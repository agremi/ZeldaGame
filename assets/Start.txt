The cold, damp stone walls rise high around you, while a heavy, stagnant air envelops you. The faint glow of a flickering torch casts dancing shadows that seem to move with you. The sound of dripping water echoes in the distance, accompanied by a whisper of wind slipping through the cracks in the rock.
Ahead, a dark corridor stretches out, with two doors: one on the left, adorned with strange carved symbols, and one on the right, emitting a faint humming sound. You can feel your heartbeat as you recall the reason for your mission: to rescue the princess, held captive in this labyrinth of darkness.
With determination, you brace yourself to face the dangers that lie ahead. Which path will you choose to take? You enter the first room.
